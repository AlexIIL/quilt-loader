Features:

- Changed the solver pre-processor to include it's state in the crash report when it encounters a contradiction.
    - This makes it easy for a loader developer to reproduce the solver state in order to debug it.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a solver pre-processor bug where chooseBasedOnOnly didn't check for new constants, resulting in later contradictions.
