Features:

- Added LanguageAdapter.getDefault(), to allow other LanguageAdapters to use it as their fallback.
- Added intermediary version detection on "Unfixable Conflicts" error, which just displays the mappings version verses the game version.
- [#369] Added some minecraft libraries to the transform cache - this allows mixin to run on them again.

Bug FIxes:

- [#377] Added overlap detection to GamePatch.process, which fixes a 1.2.5 server not launching with quilt loader (#376).
- [#375] Fix "guarenteed" typo instead of "guaranteed" (ix0rai)
- [#371] Fix access widener remapping using the constant "named" instead of fetching the target namespace (heipiao233)
